Ingka Group,"IKEA's annual sales fell 5% due to price cuts to attract more shoppers in a shrinking home furniture market. Ingka Group reported 39.6 billion euros in sales, investing over 2.1 billion euros in price cuts. Despite a decline in store visits and sold quantities, IKEA's share of the global home furnishing market remained steady at 5.7%. The company expects a sales boost in 2025 as lower interest rates drive more people to move house.",1,['IKEA sales fall 5% after price cuts amid weak housing market'],"['By Helen Reid\nLONDON (Reuters) - IKEA annual sales fell 5% after the Swedish budget homeware retailer cut prices in a bid to attract more shoppers and maintain its share of a shrinking home furniture market, but it expects a recovery next year.\nIngka Group, which owns most IKEA stores globally, reported 39.6 billion euros ($43.3 billion) in sales for its financial year ended Aug. 31.\n""In all our markets we experienced a slowdown of the economy and a slowdown of the home furnishing industry, almost simultaneously,"" said Jesper Brodin, CEO of Ingka Group. ""We never experienced anything like that since 2008, to be honest.""\nAfter seeing a decline in store visits and sold quantities, IKEA decided to cut prices, which boosted footfall and the amount of products sold, Brodin said.\nIngka Group said it invested more than 2.1 billion euros in price cuts across its markets, and its share of the global home furnishing market stayed steady at 5.7%.\nIKEA has benefited from households trading down as a global property slowdown hurt confidence, said Tolga Oncu, retail manager at Ingka Group.\nFor 2025, IKEA expects a boost to sales as lower interest rates drive more people to move house, which usually prompts buying of beds, sofas, and bookcases.\nStore visits increased by 3.3% to 727 million this year, slower than the 7.4% growth seen in 2023 and new openings fell to 41, from 60. Ingka plans 58 new locations worldwide in its 2025 financial year.\nIts share of sales made online increased to 28%, up from 26% in 2023.\nNOT GOING OUT AT CHRISTMAS\nThis holiday season, like last year, Oncu expects people to spend more time hosting at home rather than going out, with budgets still constrained by inflation.\nInter IKEA Group, which owns the IKEA brand and manufactures the products, reported annual sales of 45.1 billion euros ($49.3 billion) across all franchisees, of which Ingka Group is the biggest. That was down 5.3% compared to 2023, largely due to price cuts as the cost of raw materials like wood fell.\nInter IKEA CEO Jon Abrahamsson Ring said more price reductions were planned for its 2025 financial year, which started on Sept. 1, but likely not as significant.\n($1 = 0.9143 euros)\n(Reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\nView comments']","[""IKEA's"", 'annual', 'sales', 'fell', '5%', 'due', 'to', 'price', 'cuts', 'to', 'attract', 'more', 'shoppers', 'in', 'a', 'shrinking', 'home', 'furniture', 'market.', 'Ingka', 'Group', 'reported', '39.6', 'billion', 'euros', 'in', 'sales,', 'investing', 'over', '2.1', 'billion', 'euros', 'in', 'price', 'cuts.', 'Despite', 'a', 'decline', 'in', 'store', 'visits', 'and', 'sold', 'quantities,', ""IKEA's"", 'share', 'of', 'the', 'global', 'home', 'furnishing', 'market', 'remained', 'steady', 'at', '5.7%.', 'The', 'company', 'expects', 'a', 'sales', 'boost', 'in', '2025', 'as', 'lower', 'interest', 'rates', 'drive', 'more', 'people', 'to', 'move', 'house.']",20.0,What company reported 39.6 billion euros in sales?,True

Microsoft,"The tech sector, led by AI stocks, is driving market gains. Not all AI stocks will succeed, so analysts are evaluating Meta Platforms and Microsoft.

Microsoft, a tech giant, is integrating AI into its products and services but faces concerns about AI adoption and potential revenue impact. Analysts are bullish on both stocks, with Meta showing a modest gain potential and Microsoft offering a higher upside.",12,['Meta Platforms or Microsoft: Oppenheimer Chooses the Superior AI Stock to Buy'],"['The tech sector has been powering market gains over the past year, and AI stocks have been at the forefront of tech. AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors.\nBut not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities.\nCovering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology.\nSo, let’s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank’s choice as the superior AI stock to buy.\nMeta Platforms\nWe’ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world’s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience – at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world’s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted.\nMeta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations.\nSolid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible.\nStory continues\nBut the real work is in generative AI, and Meta has two chief developments in this field. The first is Llama, Meta’s open-source AI software model. The company has already released Llama 3, and aims to use the platform to create a flexible and readily usable AI environment. Making the platform open-source allows users to develop tweaks and additions that will meet idiosyncratic needs, as well as permitting the public to make improvements.\nIn addition to Llama, Meta has released an online AI chatbot/assistant, dubbed Meta AI. This interactive tool is available across all of the company’s social platforms, and has rapidly become a successful addition to the company’s toolbox – and popular with users. The chatbot had 400 million monthly active users at the end of August this year, with that number trending upwards quickly. Meta created Meta AI as a gen AI challenger to ChatGPT, and is well on that path.\nFor Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, the most important factor here is Meta AI. He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. “META AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META’s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.”\nThese comments support Helfstein’s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock’s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein’s track record,\nclick here\n)\nOverall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See\nMeta stock forecast\n)\nMicrosoft Corporation\nNow on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants – and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world’s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world’s third-largest publicly traded company.\nLike Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it’s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft’s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages.\nMicrosoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market – $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI’s future profits. Microsoft’s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped.\nThe company’s large AI investment hasn’t just brought it an additional income stream – Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google.\nAI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft’s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google’s Cloud and Amazon’s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users.\nBuilding out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap – but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company’s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast.\nThe company’s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected – rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for.\n5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, “We believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.”\nHoran follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan’s track record,\nclick here\n)\nWhile the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted.\nMeta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations.\nSolid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible.\nStory continues\nBut the real work is in generative AI, and Meta has two chief developments in this field. The first is Llama, Meta’s open-source AI software model. The company has already released Llama 3, and aims to use the platform to create a flexible and readily usable AI environment. Making the platform open-source allows users to develop tweaks and additions that will meet idiosyncratic needs, as well as permitting the public to make improvements.\nIn addition to Llama, Meta has released an online AI chatbot/assistant, dubbed Meta AI. This interactive tool is available across all of the company’s social platforms, and has rapidly become a successful addition to the company’s toolbox – and popular with users. The chatbot had 400 million monthly active users at the end of August this year, with that number trending upwards quickly. Meta created Meta AI as a gen AI challenger to ChatGPT, and is well on that path.\nFor Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, the most important factor here is Meta AI. He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. “META AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META’s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.”\nThese comments support Helfstein’s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock’s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein’s track record,\nclick here\n)\nOverall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See\nMeta stock forecast\n)\nMicrosoft Corporation\nNow on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants – and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world’s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world’s third-largest publicly traded company.\nLike Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it’s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft’s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages.\nMicrosoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market – $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI’s future profits. Microsoft’s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped.\nThe company’s large AI investment hasn’t just brought it an additional income stream – Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google.\nAI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft’s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google’s Cloud and Amazon’s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users.\nBuilding out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap – but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company’s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast.\nThe company’s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected – rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for.\n5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, “We believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.”\nHoran follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan’s track record,\nclick here\n)\nWhile the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

Its GAAP profit of $1.18 per share was 5.4% above analysts’ consensus estimates.\nIs now the time to buy AZZ?\nFind out in our full research report\n.\nAZZ (AZZ) Q3 CY2024 Highlights:\nRevenue:\n$409 million vs analyst estimates of $412 million (in line)\nEPS:\n$1.18 vs analyst estimates of $1.12 (5.4% beat)\nThe company\nreconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year\nof $1.58 billion at the midpoint\nEBITDA guidance for the full year\nis $340 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $347.6 million\nGross Margin (GAAP):\n25.3%, in line with the same quarter last year\nEBITDA Margin:\n22.5%, up from 18.9% in the same quarter last year\nMarket Capitalization:\n$2.40 billion\nCompany Overview\nResponsible for projects like nuclear facilities, AZZ (NYSE:AZZ) is a provider of metal coating solutions and infrastructure solutions.\nCommercial Building Products\nCommercial building products companies, which often serve more complicated projects, can supplement their core business with higher-margin installation and consulting services revenues. More recently, advances to address labor availability and job site productivity have spurred innovation. Additionally, companies in the space that can produce more energy-efficient materials have opportunities to take share. However, these companies are at the whim of commercial construction volumes, which tend to be cyclical and can be impacted heavily by economic factors such as interest rates. Additionally, the costs of raw materials can be driven by a myriad of worldwide factors and greatly influence the profitability of commercial building products companies.\nSales Growth\nA company’s long-term performance can give signals about its business quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Luckily, AZZ’s sales grew at a solid 10.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This shows it was successful in expanding, a good starting point for our analysis.\nAZZ Total Revenue\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. AZZ’s annualized revenue growth of 33.7% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated.\nThis quarter, AZZ grew its revenue by 2.6% year on year, and its $409 million of revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect sales to grow 4.7% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years.\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.\nClick here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story\n.\nOperating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses–everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nAZZ has been an optimally-run company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the industrials sector, boasting an average operating margin of 13.8%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it’s a show of well-managed operations if they’re high when gross margins are low.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, AZZ’s annual operating margin rose by 6 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it immense operating leverage.\nAZZ Operating Margin (GAAP)\nIn Q3, AZZ generated an operating profit margin of 16.5%, up 1.2 percentage points year on year. This increase was encouraging, and since its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was recently more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead.\nEarnings Per Share\nAnalyzing long-term revenue trends tells us about a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in its earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for AZZ, its EPS declined by 15.3% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 10.3%. However, its operating margin actually expanded during this timeframe, telling us non-fundamental factors affected its ultimate earnings.\nAZZ Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP)\nAZZ Diluted Shares Outstanding\nDiving into the nuances of AZZ’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. A five-year view shows AZZ has diluted its shareholders, growing its share count by 14.4%. This dilution overshadowed its increased operating efficiency and has led to lower\nper\nshare earnings. Taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can give insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For AZZ, its two-year annual EPS growth of 5.4% was higher than its five-year trend. Accelerating earnings growth is almost always a great sign.\nIn Q3, AZZ reported EPS at $1.18, up from $0.97 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 5.4%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects AZZ’s full-year EPS of $0.85 to grow by 445%.\nKey Takeaways from AZZ’s Q3 Results\nIt was good to see AZZ beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 3.7% to $78.50 immediately following the results.\nThe latest quarter from AZZ’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price.What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.\nWe cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free\n.\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\nView comments']","['AZZ', 'Inc.', '(NYSE:AZZ)', 'reported', 'Q3', 'CY2024', 'sales', 'slightly', 'below', 'analyst', 'estimates,', 'with', 'revenue', 'at', '$409', 'million,', 'up', '2.6%', 'year', 'on', 'year.', 'Full-year', 'revenue', 'guidance', 'of', '$1.58', 'billion', 'was', '1.9%', 'below', 'estimates.', 'GAAP', 'profit', 'per', 'share', 'was', '$1.18,', 'exceeding', 'consensus', 'by', '5.4%.', 'The', 'company', 'has', 'shown', 'solid', 'sales', 'growth', 'over', 'the', 'past', 'five', 'years.', 'Operating', 'margin', 'improved,', 'but', 'EPS', 'declined', 'annually', 'by', '15.3%.', 'Despite', 'a', 'weaker', 'quarter,', 'analysts', 'expect', 'EPS', 'to', 'grow', 'by', '445%', 'over', 'the', 'next', '12', 'months.']",1.0,What company reported Q3 CY2024 sales slightly below analyst estimates?,False

Meanwhile, the fixed-rate loans on banks’ books will get a boost in value, but the cash and cash equivalents they have stockpiled will earn less interest.\nIn recent quarters, banks were still working through the effects of the Fed’s rate increases. For many, increases in what they paid depositors outpaced what they brought in on loans and securities.\nUnrealized gains and losses\nBanks were caught flat-footed a couple of years ago by the Fed’s push to tame inflation by hiking rates faster than many expected. The value of many of the government bonds and mortgage-backed securities they bought when rates were lower tumbled in value, leaving them with hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized losses on their balance sheets.\nMost banks haven’t had to realize those losses, though some regional lenders did in 2023 after they were forced to sell securities to stem\na run on their deposits\n. With rates headed lower again, the carrying value of those securities should continue to inch higher, erasing the paper losses.\nInvestment-banking fees\nThe biggest banks are less dependent on their lending activities, thanks to their sizable investment banking units. Those businesses bring in hefty fees for advising corporate executives on deals and helping them sell stock or issue debt.\nAfter a two-year slump, that business flickered back to life in 2024 as the economy sidestepped a recession and the stock market rallied. Banks expect strong results again this quarter and remain bullish. Falling rates should also help, by encouraging companies to take risks and borrow more to finance their deals.\nStory continues\nTrading revenue\nMarkets were volatile during the third quarter, conditions that should produce solid trading revenue for the largest banks.\nWhile corporate executives were gaining confidence this summer in their businesses’ prospects and the economy, many consumers have been\nfeeling less upbeat\n. As the Fed wrestled to contain inflation, Americans pulled back on some expenses and grew more anxious about their job security.\nCredit-card delinquencies\nMore lower-income consumers have fallen behind\non their credit-card bills\n. In July, many of the biggest card-issuing banks reported an uptick in delinquencies and said more borrowers carried balances over from month to month.\nSome lenders said at the time that they believed those conditions had flattened during the early summer. Concerns about consumer spending flared up in early August, after data showed the nation’s unemployment rate in July had reached its highest level in nearly three years.

JPMorgan Chase,"JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo will start the earnings season for banks, with a focus on the impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut. Lower rates may have mixed effects on banks' profits, affecting lending activities and investment banking fees. The quarter saw volatile markets and concerns about credit-card delinquencies among lower-income consumers. The largest banks expect solid trading revenue amid economic uncertainties. Investors are eager to understand the implications of the rate cycle for the rest of 2024 and beyond.",15,['Five Things to Watch as JPMorgan Kicks Off Bank Earnings This Week'],"['Two of the nation’s biggest banks will kick off earnings season for lenders Friday when JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report results. It was an unusual quarter for the U.S. financial system, marked by volatile markets and the Federal Reserve’s\nfirst interest-rate cut\nin more than four years.\nThe Fed’s bigger-than-normal cut came in mid-September, too late to have much of an impact in the third quarter. But investors will be tuned in for an early look at what the\nnew phase in the rate cycle\nwill mean for the rest of 2024 and next year.\nMost Read from The Wall Street Journal\nWhen Cell Service Is Down, You Can Send iPhone Texts via Satellite\nTD Bank Faces $3 Billion in Penalties and Growth Restrictions in U.S. Settlement\nFed Minutes Reveal Divide Over Size of September Rate Cut\nThe Battle Over Robots at U.S. Ports Is On\nMcDonald’s Is Bringing Chicken to the Big Mac\nProfits from lending\nLower rates should have mixed effects on banks’ results, including what they earn from their lending activities.\nBanks will be able to pay less interest on deposits, for example, but the interest they collect on variable-rate loans may decline. Meanwhile, the fixed-rate loans on banks’ books will get a boost in value, but the cash and cash equivalents they have stockpiled will earn less interest.\nIn recent quarters, banks were still working through the effects of the Fed’s rate increases. For many, increases in what they paid depositors outpaced what they brought in on loans and securities.\nUnrealized gains and losses\nBanks were caught flat-footed a couple of years ago by the Fed’s push to tame inflation by hiking rates faster than many expected. The value of many of the government bonds and mortgage-backed securities they bought when rates were lower tumbled in value, leaving them with hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized losses on their balance sheets.\nMost banks haven’t had to realize those losses, though some regional lenders did in 2023 after they were forced to sell securities to stem\na run on their deposits\n. With rates headed lower again, the carrying value of those securities should continue to inch higher, erasing the paper losses.\nInvestment-banking fees\nThe biggest banks are less dependent on their lending activities, thanks to their sizable investment banking units. Those businesses bring in hefty fees for advising corporate executives on deals and helping them sell stock or issue debt.\nAfter a two-year slump, that business flickered back to life in 2024 as the economy sidestepped a recession and the stock market rallied. Banks expect strong results again this quarter and remain bullish. Falling rates should also help, by encouraging companies to take risks and borrow more to finance their deals.\nStory continues\nTrading revenue\nMarkets were volatile during the third quarter, conditions that should produce solid trading revenue for the largest banks.\nWhile corporate executives were gaining confidence this summer in their businesses’ prospects and the economy, many consumers have been\nfeeling less upbeat\n.

No, ma’am.’ But we can’t let that stop us from getting to root-cause discussions. We need to challenge ideas, not each other.”\nBy land, air, sea, and space\nTownes-Whitley’s year of transformation as CEO has included forming SAIC’s national imperatives, its list of critical challenges in the US that require technology, which she said are key to driving both internal and external engagement. These imperatives include undersea dominance, border security, improving citizen experience, all-domain warfighting, and next-generation space technologies.\nThese priorities reflect the strategic demands of SAIC’s top clients, including NASA and the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.\n""When we launched the imperatives … [everybody was] doing their thing,"" Townes-Whitley recalled.

Toni,"Toni Townes-Whitley, CEO of SAIC, is driving cutting-edge technology ethically. She aims to modernize the 55-year-old company by focusing on tech-driven approaches, including ethical AI. SAIC is expanding into non-military operations and investing in its workforce to foster innovation. Townes-Whitley promotes inclusivity and challenges ideas respectfully. Under her leadership, SAIC's stock price has risen, and the company secured new deals aligned with its mission of advancing technology ethically for national security.",23,['SAIC CEO Toni Townes-Whitley drives new era of growth for the defense tech company with AI'],"['The business of war, deterrence, and national security has long incorporated cutting-edge technology.\nToni Townes-Whitley, the CEO of Science Applications International Corporation, or SAIC, is on a mission to drive that cutting-edge technology but to do so ethically.\nTownes-Whitley took over the top job at Virginia-based SAIC in October 2023 while the Russia-Ukraine war raged on and just days before Hamas’s attack on Israel. Tasked with bringing the 55-year-old company into the modern age and expanding its reach, Townes-Whitley set to work shifting SAIC’s efforts to a more robust, tech-driven approach.\n“As soon as that conflict was communicated, SAIC had teams on the ground supporting customers that were providing capabilities there,” Townes-Whitley told Yahoo Finance (video above). “You\'re in the middle of a global conflict: What data is flowing? How can that data be shared, not only with the US forces but with multiple coalition forces?”\nA Ukrainian soldier checks a military GPS tracker near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war in Bakhmut, Ukraine on April 2, 2023. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n(Anadolu via Getty Images)\nThe key to Townes-Whitley’s vision — and to SAIC’s transformation — has been introducing artificial intelligence into SAIC’s offerings and setting standards for ""ethical AI,"" which Townes-Whitley says is imperative to ensuring the company’s leadership as a provider of security and military software and resources.\n“Think of the ethics as a portfolio of understanding the maturity of the technology, its ability to actually do what it says,” Townes-Whitley explained. “Initial AI was so immature. We were just testing to see what the algorithms could do. So was the AI itself ethical? It was just simply immature.”\nShe added that SAIC considers possible sensitive and unintended use cases for its technology, such as the consequences of biometric identification in the judicial system and in various industries. At its 24,000-square-foot testing facility in Maryland, company scientists continue to test ways AI can bring security, technology, and public trust together in more ethical and profitable ways.\n""We built the first ethical framework for AI at Microsoft, and now at SAIC, we have the same kinds of frameworks about how we think about the consequences of the technology we’re building,"" she added.\n\'Challenge ideas, not each other\'\nSAIC is much more than a provider of military systems and supporting technology. Since its founding in 1967, the company has broadened its focus over the years to specialize in data analysis, security, and modern warfare — specifically by supplying technology and resources to the US military, one of its biggest customers.\nThe $7.1 billion company is also involved in non-military operations and support, including training all US air traffic controllers using operational AI.\nStory continues\nDespite years of success, SAIC has suffered from competition as well as a lack of innovation. It also had a less-than-energized workforce that wasn’t being as proactive or creative in bringing new forms of technology and cybersecurity to the table.\nTownes-Whitley has started to tackle this by investing in SAIC’s workforce.\n""We know that the skills we will need are not just skills we can find in the market,"" she said.

Federal Reserve,"The Federal Reserve was divided on the size of its first interest rate cut in over four years, with some officials supporting a 50 basis point reduction while others preferred a smaller 25 basis point cut. The decision to cut by 50 basis points was announced despite internal dissent, with some policymakers favoring additional rate cuts while others preferred a more gradual approach. The central bank aims to balance risks to unemployment and inflation while communicating that rate cuts do not signal a negative economic outlook.",26,['Fed minutes reveal lively September debate about whether first rate cut should be big or small'],"['There was a divide within the Federal Reserve about whether its first interest rate cut in more than four years should be big or small, according to minutes from the central bank\'s September meeting released Wednesday.\nA ""substantial majority"" of Fed officials supported lowering rates by 50 basis points at the last meeting, but “some” would have preferred to have lowered by 25 basis points and ""a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision,"" the minutes read.\nThose who argued for a 25 basis point reduction noted that inflation was still somewhat elevated, while economic growth was strong and unemployment low.\nSeveral said a smaller cut would line up more with a gradual reduction in the policy rate that would be more predictable and allow more time to assess any impacts on the economy.\nThose who argued for a jumbo-sized cut said a 50 basis point move would help sustain strength in the economy and the job market while continuing to bring down inflation.\nSome even said there had been a case for a 25 basis point rate cut at the previous meeting in July, and that recent data offered even more evidence that inflation continues to drop while the labor market cools.\nSome of this internal division at the Fed was made public on Sept. 18 as the decision to cut by 50 basis points was announced, with Fed governor Michelle Bowman dissenting and saying she preferred 25 basis points.\nNo Fed official had voted against a policy decision in two years, matching one of the longest such streaks in the past half-century. Moreover, no Fed governor had dissented on a rate decision since 2005.\nThe Fed\'s rate-setting committee was also almost evenly split on the number of additional rate cuts expected this year, with seven policymakers favoring one additional 25 basis point rate cut before year-end and nine members favoring 50 basis points of additional easing. Two policymakers expected no more rate cuts.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, in a press conference with reporters last month, acknowledged the dissent but also said there was ""broad support"" for the cut and a ""lot of common ground"" among his fellow policymakers.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, at last month\'s press conference. (REUTERS/Tom Brenner)\n(Reuters / Reuters)\nIn the week since the decision, several policymakers have offered public support for a jumbo rate cut of 50 basis points, citing progress on inflation and a cooling job market.\nAtlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic has said that residual concerns might have led him to trim by a smaller 25 basis points at the September policy meeting, but that would have ignored a recent cooling in the job market.\nStory continues\nMinneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said he voted in favor of cutting by 50 basis points because ""the balance of risks has shifted away from higher inflation and toward the risk of a further weakening of the labor market, warranting a lower federal funds rate.""\nChicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee also said he was ""comfortable"" with a 50 basis point cut, viewing it ""as a demarcation"" that the central bank is now back to thinking as much about achieving maximum employment as it is price stability.\nBut a stronger-than-expected jobs report released last week now has analysts wondering whether the central bank will curtail rate cuts or if it moved too quickly with a 50 basis point reduction. There are also worries that inflation could be re-elevated as a concern.\nFed officials will get a fresh reading on inflation Thursday when the Consumer Price Index is due out. That measure is expected to keep in line with what officials want to see.\nEconomists expect core inflation — which eliminates volatile food and energy prices the Fed can’t control — held steady on an annual basis in September at 3.2% from the same level in August. Month over month, CPI is expected to have grown by 0.2%, compared with 0.3% in August.\nSome Fed officials are urging a gradual path to cuts as they look to balance downside risks to unemployment with continuing to bring down inflation.\nDallas Fed president Lorie Logan became the latest official to voice that view on Wednesday, saying in a speech that “a more gradual path back to a normal policy stance will likely be appropriate from here to best balance the risks to our dual-mandate goals.”\nPowell made it clear in remarks on Sept. 30 that the central bank isn’t in a ""hurry"" to bring interest rates down and would prefer smaller cuts.\nHe also reiterated that the consensus of Fed officials outlined at the September meeting was for two more 25 basis point rate cuts this year, saying, “it wouldn\'t mean more fifties.”\nOther officials, including New York Fed President John Williams, St. Louis Fed president Alberto Musalem, and Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee, all have said recently they favor bringing interest rates lower “over time.”\nAt the September meeting, according to the minutes, officials said it’s important to communicate that lowering rates should not be interpreted to mean the Fed believes the economic outlook has soured or that the Fed will lower rates more rapidly than the path laid out.\n“Some participants emphasized that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity and employment. A few participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way,” the minutes read.\nAlmost all participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook as having diminished, while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased.\nWhile Fed officials generally viewed the job market as solid, some said that the recent pace of job increases had fallen short of what was required to keep the unemployment rate stable on a sustained basis, assuming a constant labor force participation rate.\nMany said that evaluating the job market had been challenging, with increased immigration, revisions to reported payroll data, and possible changes in the underlying growth rate of productivity.\nSeveral participants emphasized the importance of continuing to use disaggregated data or information provided by business contacts as a check on readings on labor market conditions obtained from aggregate data.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nView comments']","['The', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'was', 'divided', 'on', 'the', 'size', 'of', 'its', 'first', 'interest', 'rate', 'cut', 'in', 'over', 'four', 'years,', 'with', 'some', 'officials', 'supporting', 'a', '50', 'basis', 'point', 'reduction', 'while', 'others', 'preferred', 'a', 'smaller', '25', 'basis', 'point', 'cut.', 'The', 'decision', 'to', 'cut', 'by', '50', 'basis', 'points', 'was', 'announced', 'despite', 'internal', 'dissent,', 'with', 'some', 'policymakers', 'favoring', 'additional', 'rate', 'cuts', 'while', 'others', 'preferred', 'a', 'more', 'gradual', 'approach.', 'The', 'central', 'bank', 'aims', 'to', 'balance', 'risks', 'to', 'unemployment', 'and', 'inflation', 'while', 'communicating', 'that', 'rate', 'cuts', 'do', 'not', 'signal', 'a', 'negative', 'economic', 'outlook.']",2.0,What institution was divided on the size of its first rate cut in over four years?,False

Llama,"Meta has emerged as a major player in artificial intelligence, with its Llama models being used across its social platforms and by businesses. The company is offering its Llama models as open-source software, democratizing AI and potentially creating a revenue stream. While Meta's AI strategy is seen as a long-term investment, competitors like OpenAI and Google are also advancing in the AI space. Meta's success in AI could boost its own products and revenue in the future.",27,['How Meta has become an AI behemoth'],"[""When you think of Meta (\nMETA\n), you might think of Facebook, Instagram, or, shudder, the metaverse. But the social media company has quickly become an artificial intelligence darling up there with the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft (\nMSFT\n), and Google (\nGOOG\n,\nGOOGL\n).\nMeta’s AI success comes via its Llama family of models, which the company is infusing across its various social platforms — including its Meta AI assistant for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Businesses are also putting Llama to work. In August, Meta reported organizations ranging from Accenture (\nACN\n) and DoorDash (\nDASH\n) to Goldman Sachs (\nGS\n) are using Llama to develop their own AI software.\nIt’s not just that Meta is implementing its AI into its own products, though.

Regulatory scrutiny in the commercial real estate market has led to criminal investigations and tighter rules for lenders and brokers.",39,['Mortgage Broker Meridian Will Be Freed From Freddie Mac Ban'],"['(Bloomberg) -- Mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group will be freed from a Freddie Mac ban months after Freddie stopped buying loans handled by the firm amid an industrywide crackdown on fraud.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nChicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation\nSan Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes\nShould Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters?\nFrom Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\nStarting on Jan. 1, Freddie Mac will begin considering Meridian-brokered loans again as long as lenders comply with a suite of new conditions.\nThe decision “comes after a thorough review process and enhancements to our lender requirements,” a Freddie Mac spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe move comes amid intense regulatory scrutiny of the commercial real estate market that has sparked several criminal investigations and a tightening of rules for lenders and brokers.\nAs part of the new conditions, Freddie can require lenders that bring in Meridian-brokered business to repurchase loans in case of default in the first 12 months or if fraud is uncovered, according to a person familiar with the agreement. There will be additional requirements over inspections, audits and the accuracy of information used during the underwriting process, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details of the agreement aren’t yet public.\n‘New Environment’\nMeridian Chief Executive Officer Brian Brooks said Freddie’s decision lets the firm serve its clients better.\n“We’ve now charted a course that shows what a trusted brokerage looks like in this new environment,” he said in an email.\nMeridian is a major commercial mortgage broker, having secured more than $550 billion in financing since its founding in 1991. Staying in the good graces of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is crucial for such firms, which, among other specialties, arrange loans to apartment owners that are eventually purchased and packaged into securities by the two government-sponsored entities.\nMeridian, which has worked with lenders including New York Community Bancorp, was banned by Freddie and Fannie over allegations that some brokers had fudged figures on applications to obtain larger loans, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.\nFannie didn’t respond to requests for comment. Its pause on Meridian business stands.\nImportance to Meridian\nLoans for multifamily projects have accounted for a “substantial component” of Meridian’s business. The firm has arranged more than $136 billion in such financing across the country over the past five years, according to its website.\nStory continues\nAfter Freddie’s pause, Meridian in March appointed Brooks, a former regulator, as CEO, replacing the firm’s co-founder Ralph Herzka, who became senior chairman. Some executives and brokers left the firm, as a sluggish commercial real estate market and the Fannie and Freddie bans hampered Meridian’s ability to broker loans.\nThe scrutiny hasn’t been limited to Meridian. US regulators and prosecutors have been cracking down on allegations of fraud in corners of the commercial real estate finance market as higher-for-longer interest rates have made it difficult for investors to paper over shady deals.\nIn June, a New Jersey investor named Aron Puretz pleaded guilty to using false financial statements to obtain nearly $55 million in loans to purchase properties in Michigan, Illinois and Arkansas. In a related case, another real estate player, Boruch Drillman, pleaded guilty in December to deceiving lenders in a $165 million mortgage fraud conspiracy.\n--With assistance from Scott Carpenter and Natalie Wong.\n(Adds CEO comment in second section and background in third.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes)\nHow Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession\nRate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView comments']","['Meridian', 'Capital', 'Group,', 'a', 'major', 'commercial', 'mortgage', 'broker,', 'will', 'be', 'reinstated', 'by', 'Freddie', 'Mac', 'after', 'a', 'ban', 'due', 'to', 'industrywide', 'fraud', 'crackdown.', 'The', 'decision', 'follows', 'enhanced', 'lender', 'requirements', 'and', 'new', 'conditions,', 'including', 'potential', 'loan', 'repurchases', 'in', 'case', 'of', 'default', 'or', 'fraud.', 'Meridian', 'CEO', 'Brian', 'Brooks', 'welcomed', 'the', 'decision,', 'emphasizing', 'the', 'importance', 'of', 'maintaining', 'good', 'relationships', 'with', 'Fannie', 'Mae', 'and', 'Freddie', 'Mac.', 'Regulatory', 'scrutiny', 'in', 'the', 'commercial', 'real', 'estate', 'market', 'has', 'led', 'to', 'criminal', 'investigations', 'and', 'tighter', 'rules', 'for', 'lenders', 'and', 'brokers.']",1.0,What is Meridian's major commercial mortgage broker?,False

Despite this, compared to the same week in 2023, purchase applications increased by 8% and refinance applications by 159%. Mortgage rates rose to 6.36%, the highest since August, impacting consumer demand. Government lending remained steady, with FHA loans decreasing and VA loans increasing in market share. Jumbo loan interest rates also increased.",42,"['Mortgage demand drops as interest rates rise, economy remains resilient']","['After reaching their highest level\nsince July 2022\n,\nmortgage applications\nhave declined for two straight weeks, counteracting some\nrecent positive signs\nfor a still-sputtering housing industry.\nAccording to weekly data released Wednesday by the\nMortgage Bankers Association\n(MBA), applications shrank 5.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis during the week ending Oct. 4. This included a 9% weekly decline in refinance applications and a 0.1% decline in purchase loan demand.\nCompared to same week in 2023, however, purchase applications were up 8% and refi applications were up 159%.\n“In the wake of stronger economic data last week, including the\nSeptember jobs report\n,\nmortgage rates\nmoved higher, with the 30-year fixed rate rising to 6.36 percent — the highest since August,”\nMike Fratantoni\n, MBA’s senior vice president and chief economist, said in a statement. “Conventional loan refinances, which tend to have larger balances than government loans and hence are more responsive for a given change in mortgage rates, fell to a greater extent over the week.”\nRefis have become\nmore prevalent of late\nas interest rates have dropped enough from the recent peaks to put more borrowers in the money. But the refi share of mortgage activity dropped last week by 250 basis points (bps) and accounted for 52.4% of new applications.\nIn reference to the purchase market, Fratantoni observed that a couple key factors continue to play a role in consumer demand.\n“As we have highlighted before, the decision to buy a home is impacted by many factors, not just the level of mortgage rates,“ he said. “The largest constraint for many prospective homebuyers over the past year had been the\nlack of inventory\n. Now, there are more homes available\nin many markets\nacross the country, and with mortgage rates still low compared to recent history, at least some potential homebuyers are moving ahead.”\nMBA data showed that\ngovernment lending\ncontinues to represent a steady share of the mortgage market. For the week ending Oct. 4,\nFederal Housing Administration\n(FHA) loans decreased by 40 bps and represented 16.2% of all applications, while\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\n(VA) loans rose by 150 bps to account for 16.9% of applications.\nThe average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate loans with conforming balances ($766,550 or less) jumped from 6.14% to 6.36% during the week. Lender points, including origination fees, increased slightly to an average of 0.62 for mortgages with 80% loan-to-value (LTV) ratios.\nInterest rates for\njumbo loans\n(balances of more than $766,550) moved 12 bps higher during the week, averaging 6.64%. Lender points averaged 0.5, up 14 bps, on 80% LTV loans.\nStory continues\nAdjustable-rate mortgages (\nARMs\n) increased to 5.9% of all applications.\nThe MBA’s survey covers more than 75% of all U.S. retail residential mortgage applications across a variety of independent mortgage banks, commercial banks and thrifts.

AccountTECH,"The potential drop in commission rates due to an antitrust lawsuit settlement poses a significant threat to brokerages, particularly larger ones with higher expenditures. Data from AccountTECH shows that smaller brokerages are less sensitive to lower commissions, with those having 75-100 agents being in the best position to sustain drops. To improve profitability, brokerages in the red can consider reducing office space or negotiating higher commission splits. Different brokerages have reported varying impacts on commissions following the settlement.",43,"['If commission rates drop, these real estate brokerages could be in trouble']","['Brokerage Profitability\nIf commission rates drop significantly as a result of the\nNational Association of Realtors\nantitrust lawsuit\nsettlement,\nit’s potentially an existential threat to many brokerages. But which ones and how many?\nData from\nAccountTECH\nmight bring us closer to an answer. Based on a sample of 100 brokerages of varying sizes and expenditures, the data shows a general trend of larger brokerages being more sensitive to a drop in commission rates than smaller ones.\nThat’s because many large brokerages still pay for office space and middle management.\n“You know that expression they tell you at Weight Watchers — don’t eat bread because you’re probably going to put jam on it?” asked AccountTECH CEO Mark Blagden. “Don’t open an office because you’re going to have to staff it.”\nBlagden’s study divides the sample by agent count at brokerages and then applies different commission rates to their 2023 financials. The commission splits at the brokerages and their expenditures are held constant.\nWhile smaller brokerages are generally starting from better financial footing, they’re also less sensitive to lower commissions. For brokerages with fewer than 30 agents, 65% are profitable at a 3% commission rate while 35% are profitable at a 2% commission.\nA 30 percentage point drop is certainly dramatic, but for brokerages with an agent count between 75 and 100 agents, 90% are profitable at a 3% commission and only 20% are profitable at a 2% commission, 70 percentage point drop.\nLarger brokerages are already struggling, though it’s fair to say they have more resources at their disposal to. For brokerages with an agent count between 200 and 300, only 42% are profitable at a 3% commission and it drops to 17% at 2.5%, according to AccountTech. With an agent count between 100 and 200, 64% are profitable at a 3% commission, but that number plunges to 9% at a 2.25% commission.\nBlagden says that the 50-to-75-agent brokerages are in the best position to sustain drops. He sees the average commission right now being about 2.5%, and 70% of brokerages in that agent count range are profitable, which is significantly higher than other ranges.\nWhile those brokerages do see a drop to just 20% at a 2% commission rate, that’s more than brokerages above 50 agents, and it only drops below 50% at that rate.\n“Having 75 to 100 agents seems to be the best place to be because you don’t necessarily have to have management, you don’t have to have a lot of offices, you don’t have to have a lot of managers, and you can just take most of that to the bottom line in terms of profit,” he said.\nStory continues\nHe added that the most impactful ways for brokerages operating in the red to get into the black is to dump office space or take a higher split of commissions.\nWhile it’s largely expected that commissions will drop as a result of the new settlement rules, different brokerages have reported different numbers.

Those included Armani, Dolce & Gabbana, Ferragamo and Tod’s, Chief Business Officer Jason Chen told Bloomberg News.\nThat courtship is one aspect of a campaign to try and fend off Sea Ltd.’s Shopee, ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and PDD Holdings Inc. in a Southeast Asian online commerce arena expected to reach $186 billion by 2025. TikTok and Shopee in particular have vied fiercely for merchants and shoppers in key markets from Indonesia to Singapore.\n“Lazada is ready to ramp up as entering this new phase of e-commerce development, where profitability, commercialization and long-term gains are priorities for the business,” Chen said in an online Zoom interview. “The current push to broaden our luxury segment will further fuel these efforts as we reinforce our brand positioning.”\nLazada and AliExpress are at the heart of Alibaba’s business outside China, now among its fastest-growing divisions because of an economic downturn back home.\nAlibaba, which under new management is recovering from a years-long crackdown on its business by Beijing, is now driving expansion in the Asian region. One of its biggest rivals there is Sea, which in August raised its retail sales outlook in a sign it’s making headway in that market.\nHigh-end demand is key to Alibaba’s effort, Chen said. Along with India and the Middle East, Southeast Asia is regarded as one of the world’s faster-growing markets for luxury, especially as China grapples with a sagging economy.\nUnlike rivals, Lazada can offer brands more control over pricing and marketing, he argued. Alibaba’s Tmall Luxury Pavilion, created in 2017 and now a repository for some 200 brands, offers a template for Lazada, Chen said.\n“When a company decides to open its own online store on our platform, it manages all the operations, from pricing to logistics,” he said. “This is particularly important for the fashion houses, which are keen to keep control of the entire selling process.”\nStory continues\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes)\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nHow Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession\nRate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView comments']","[""Alibaba's"", 'Lazada', 'is', 'targeting', 'European', 'fashion', 'brands', 'to', 'boost', 'e-commerce', 'volume', 'to', '$100', 'billion', 'by', '2030,', 'aiming', 'to', 'compete', 'with', 'Asian', 'rivals', 'like', 'Sea', ""Ltd.'s"", 'Shopee', 'and', 'ByteDance', ""Ltd.'s"", 'TikTok.', ""Lazada's"", 'focus', 'on', 'luxury', 'brands', 'and', 'offering', 'control', 'over', 'pricing', 'and', 'marketing', 'sets', 'it', 'apart.', 'Alibaba', 'sees', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'as', 'a', 'key', 'market', 'for', 'luxury', 'growth,', 'with', 'Lazada', 'and', 'AliExpress', 'driving', 'expansion', 'outside', 'China.', 'The', 'company', 'aims', 'to', 'strengthen', 'its', 'brand', 'positioning', 'and', 'profitability', 'in', 'the', 'region.']",59.0,What company is Lazada partnering with to drive expansion outside China?,False

TikTok and Shopee in particular have vied fiercely for merchants and shoppers in key markets from Indonesia to Singapore.\n“Lazada is ready to ramp up as entering this new phase of e-commerce development, where profitability, commercialization and long-term gains are priorities for the business,” Chen said in an online Zoom interview. “The current push to broaden our luxury segment will further fuel these efforts as we reinforce our brand positioning.”\nLazada and AliExpress are at the heart of Alibaba’s business outside China, now among its fastest-growing divisions because of an economic downturn back home.\nAlibaba, which under new management is recovering from a years-long crackdown on its business by Beijing, is now driving expansion in the Asian region. One of its biggest rivals there is Sea, which in August raised its retail sales outlook in a sign it’s making headway in that market.\nHigh-end demand is key to Alibaba’s effort, Chen said. Along with India and the Middle East, Southeast Asia is regarded as one of the world’s faster-growing markets for luxury, especially as China grapples with a sagging economy.\nUnlike rivals, Lazada can offer brands more control over pricing and marketing, he argued. Alibaba’s Tmall Luxury Pavilion, created in 2017 and now a repository for some 200 brands, offers a template for Lazada, Chen said.\n“When a company decides to open its own online store on our platform, it manages all the operations, from pricing to logistics,” he said. “This is particularly important for the fashion houses, which are keen to keep control of the entire selling process.”\nStory continues\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes)\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nHow Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession\nRate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\nView comments']","[""Alibaba's"", 'Lazada', 'is', 'targeting', 'European', 'fashion', 'brands', 'to', 'boost', 'e-commerce', 'volume', 'to', '$100', 'billion', 'by', '2030,', 'aiming', 'to', 'compete', 'with', 'Asian', 'rivals', 'like', 'Sea', ""Ltd.'s"", 'Shopee', 'and', 'ByteDance', ""Ltd.'s"", 'TikTok.', ""Lazada's"", 'focus', 'on', 'luxury', 'brands', 'and', 'offering', 'control', 'over', 'pricing', 'and', 'marketing', 'sets', 'it', 'apart.', 'Alibaba', 'sees', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'as', 'a', 'key', 'market', 'for', 'luxury', 'growth,', 'with', 'Lazada', 'and', 'AliExpress', 'driving', 'expansion', 'outside', 'China.', 'The', 'company', 'aims', 'to', 'strengthen', 'its', 'brand', 'positioning', 'and', 'profitability', 'in', 'the', 'region.']",4.0,What type of fashion brands is Lazada targeting?,True
